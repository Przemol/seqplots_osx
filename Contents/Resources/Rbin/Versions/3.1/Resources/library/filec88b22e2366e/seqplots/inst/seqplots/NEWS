SeqPlots v0.8.2b
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES:
* Hierarchical and super self-organizing network clustering added for heatmaps
* Anchored motif plots
* The row order of the heatmap is exported along with cluster report

GENERAL:
* JS color picker added for browsers, that do not support <select type="color"> i.e. Firefox (checked with modernizr.js library)
* Single process mode and Microsoft Windows compatibility (running without fork parallelization)
* Shiny 0.9.1 compatibility
* Saved datasets can be downloaded for local usage
* Clicking row or column name in plot grid toggles the checkboxes
* Minor GUI changes


SeqPlots v0.8.1b
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL:
* GUI redesign: plot matrix incorporates sub-plot/heatmap specific controls,
all heatmap options gathered in single tab
* warning before closing/refreshing a webpage with active session
* cookie based default options: user, genome and deactivate page exit warning
* heat-map clusters provided as cluster report - a CSV file containing original features, annotations 
and cluster information, see more:https://bitbucket.org/przemol/seqplots/wiki/Heatmaps#markdown-header-cluster-report
* Wiggle files processing: correct for multiple header definitions and roman/arabic chromosome names correction 
* Optimised keyboard shortcuts: plot - RETUTRN or ctrl/cmd+SPACE, switch heatmap - ctrl/cmd+H,
switch reactive plotting - ctrl/cmd+R
* minor speed improvement

BUGFIX:
* Motif density plots and heatmaps: flip rows on (-) strand


SeqPlots v0.8.0b
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GENERAL:
* GUI redesign, option partitioned to more tabs
* preview plot is zoomed on click rather than on mouse hover
* possibility to remove multiple files
* comments visible as popup in file managmed window
* all chromosome naming conventions (most notably chrX/X and variants of chrM/M/MtDNA/MT etc.)
are accepted (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/data/annotation/html/seqnames.db.html)
* incoming featurefiles (GFF and BED) are not processed, just chacked for errors
* explicit error handling for incoming flies, the line with problem or unexpected chromosome(s)
are indentified to the user
* motif density tracks can be binned (defoult at 10bp)
* tracks amd motif densities cna be mixed together in plots

SERVER:
* server_config.R added - a configuration file that allows to set up server varaiables, e.g.
the user data location

MAC OS X APP:
* interface to insrall new genomes from Bioconductor and local resources 
(R BSgemome format: http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BSgenome.html)
* option to set up data location


SeqPlots v0.7.0a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SeqPlots for Mac OS X relesed - an user frienddly wrapper app containig R, packages and SeqPlots coede
* heatmap plotting added
* motif denstty plotting added for lineplot and heatmap
* minior interface redesign
* reactive interface can be turn off for plottting, user plots on demend
* adding files from jQuery File Upload (http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/) 
is handled directly by R eliminating additional node.js server application and making proper file
handling for desktop version
* computationally expensive operations (calculating plot matrix and plotting) are handeled by new R
process (parallel R library) - many proces can run simmutainously in same Shiny instance, user can get 
fedback from the calcualtion can be cancelled


SeqPlots v0.6.0a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Shiny (https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) used as R web fraimwork, support for Rserver/EXT JS version dropped
* support for 145 genomes from UCSC database (via user provideing valid genome symbol)
* new reactive user interface
* new plot type: midpoint features - it calculates the middle of given features and centres the summary on it
* the option to ignore the strand (plot always in the same direction)
* the option to remove the zeros (0 value of score in Wiggle track) from mean and error estimate calculations
* the support for BED feature files (in addition to GFF, Wiggle (all variants), BigWiggle)
* automatic chromosome name correction for C. elegans genomes (I => chrI, MtDNA => chrM, etc.)
* accepts wiggle with overlapping ranges (e.g. microarray experiments processed using MA2C)
* basic user management for uploaded files
* option to download the features and track files directly from application


SeqPlots v0.1.0a - v0.5.0a
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Initial test and alpha releases
